# Malware Dropper x64 Win Assembly

This repository contains the code found in my blog post, [Converting a malware dropper to x64 assembly](https://www.accidentalrebel.com/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly.html), where I converted a simple malware dropper written in C to x64 assembly.

## How to run

* Install [NASM](https://nasm.us)
* Make sure you have have the Visual Studio C++ development environment setup
* Run `build_and_run.bat`

## Credits

The original malware dropper code in C was written by [@reenz0h](https://twitter.com/sektor7net). I found it in [kymb0's repository](https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns) and I learned that it's a part of the [Red Team Operator course by Sektor7](https://institute.sektor7.net/).
